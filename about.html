            <ul class="about-points">
                <li><strong>Purpose and Role:</strong> The Bank of Canada serves as the nation’s central bank, responsible for regulating monetary policy, issuing currency, and ensuring financial stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishment:</strong> Founded in 1934 during the Great Depression to address economic instability and centralize financial oversight.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Structure:</strong> Began operations on March 11, 1935, as a privately owned institution, with shares sold to the public to maintain independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Nationalization:</strong> Transitioned to full public ownership by 1938 under the Liberal government, becoming a Crown corporation.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Emerged from a need to replace the unstable system of private banknote issuance by chartered banks, such as the Bank of Montreal (est. 1817).</li>
                <li><strong>Key Milestones:</strong> Became the sole issuer of Canadian currency by 1944, with private banknotes phased out by 1950.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Guided by its first Governor, Graham F. Towers (1934–1954), through its formative years and nationalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Mission:</strong> Committed to fostering economic stability, controlling inflation, and supporting Canada’s financial infrastructure.</li>
